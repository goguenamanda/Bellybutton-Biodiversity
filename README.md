# Bellybutton-Biodiversity

## Project Description

In this project, scientists collected data from a multitude of participants on various bacteria living in their bellybuttons. In this analysis, I compared the different species and population sizes, which I then compared against the frequency in which the participant washed their bellybutton. I created various charts and graphs to illustrate the data in a visually appealing manner.
